				<h2>The Travel Globe</h2>
				<h3>A Project Green Article - Youtube Video - Published on Mar 22, 2019</h3>
				<p>With a new demo on the horizon, I realized Project Green needed a travel system.
				The globe from odyssey seemed like a good option for the situation, and I always thought it would be a good idea.
				I decided to make at least a placeholder map (globe texture) as well, even if it isnt accurate for the upcoming locations-
				so don't start speculating about that. It was a bit of a challenge, but after some cool and good coding I got it done relatively quick,
				and it was really fun to do and I was pretty proud of the end result. You can visit the youtube video
				(see below article title) to view this masta peice. Additionally that is not the final model,
				it will probably be upscaled in terms of polygons so that you can't easily see the sides of the model.</p>

				<h2>Bowser JR. appears!</h2>
				<h3>A Project Green Article - Published on Published on Mar 15, 2019</h3>
				<p>Bowser JR. is going to be a boss in Project Green, development beginning on the creation of this article.
				It isnt expected to be easy to make or beat this fight, but I'll try my hardest to get it done in a timely manner;
				It should have a decent amount of attacks as a boss, to keep some vareity and keep it interesting.
				Most things will be interactable with by Cappy, with him not playing a direct role in the fight until possibly later on.</p>
