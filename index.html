				<h1>Welcome to my humble abode.</h1>
				<p>Hello there, my name is Snarf, an American game developer who puts enjoyment before the money.
				   Im currently focused on creating fangames, but someday may move to retail production of my own, original games.
				<br />
				   I've put lots of time into learning blueprints in unreal, animating, and put a little time into modeling.
				   Game design and level design are some of my greatest strengths.</p>
				<h1>Project Green</h1>
				<p>Project Green is a Mario fangame based around giving the spotlight to Luigi in his own title.
				   The mechanics are strongly based around odyssey, but we continue to build on it, adding new captures,
				   mechanics, and still making sure it feels good. Its been in development for roughly two years,
				   and has been recognized by youtubers such as the Hobo Bros.</p>
				<p>We continue to innovate upon the game, add new features, and periodically release new demos.
				   We hope you look forward to its completion and playing it as much as we do.</p>
